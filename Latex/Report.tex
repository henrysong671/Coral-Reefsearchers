\section{Introduction}
Coral reefs play a crucial role in the marine's ecosystem as it serves a purpose for an abundance of marine life. Additionally, healthy coral reefs benefit the economy as it provides jobs and businesses through tourism. Unfortunately, in the recent years the health of coral reefs have been declining due to several factors. According to a 2008 world coral reef status report, it predicts that 15\% of all coral are in danger of disappearing within 10-20 years, and 20\% within 20-40 years \textsuperscript{\cite{05_quintero_machuca_cotto_bradley_ríos-soto_2016}}. 

With climate change rates increasing, one of the prevalent factors affecting coral reefs is rising sea temperatures, which leads to mass bleaching of corals. Other destructive environmental factors include ocean acidification, nutrient flow from run-off \textsuperscript{\cite{05_quintero_machuca_cotto_bradley_ríos-soto_2016}}. Another factor that contributes to the decline of healthy coral reefs are due to human activities, such as exploitative fishing practices or pollution \textsuperscript{\cite{04_mathanalysis}}. 

Because a handful of coral species are considered to be threatened, efforts in measuring the resiliency factors of a coral reef has been of interest to many. In one study, ecological factors were studied and scored in which resistance, recovery, and resilience were taken into account. It claimed the top three ecological factors that contribute a coral's resiliency is its species type, temperature variability, and nutrients for pollution run-off \textsuperscript{\cite{02_Riegl_Purkis_Model}}. 

The objective of this paper is to analyze how Guam's reef ecosystem will change over the coming decades, focusing on the impact of overfishing of parrotfish. By setting up a compartment model and subsequent system of differential equations, we are able to model the dynamics of the ecosystem in response to different parameter and compartment values. This will allow us to analyze and predict the effect of overfishing on Guam's coral reef ecosystem. In addition, our analysis will include the application of education game theory in order to quantify the human factor in overfishing.

% assumptions and description of model
We assume that the (i) system is closed, (ii) it only consists of coral, macroalgae, and algal turfs, and (iii) macroalgae is the only predator for coral. Corals are assumed to (iv) recruit and overgrow algal turfs and that they are overgrown by macroalgae \textsuperscript{\cite{04_mathanalysis}}. Macroalgae are also assumed (v) colonize dead coral by spreading vegetative over algal turfs \textsuperscript{\cite{04_mathanalysis}}. In addition, (vi) corals do not die naturally and (vii) the maximum carrying capacity of parrotfish is equal to 1.

%Represented above is our general compartment model. While this version is a rough draft, it represents the compartments that we wish to include in our model. Included in our model is our $S$ compartment, which represents all susceptible corals, our $E$ compartment representing all exposed corals, our $I$ compartment representing our infected corals, and our $R$ compartment representing recovered corals. While this follows the standard SEIR model layout, we included an $H$ compartment to account for human factors. This is in order to assess how the human factor may directly or indirectly affect the typical "life" cycle of corals. \par
%The $H$ compartment allows to factor in the human factor to the overall equation, however in order to achieve this, we must implement education game theory. This is in order to model human factors such as education about corals, ignorance, and various other factors. By using education game theory, we are able to visualize which strategy is dominant between humans and corals, and reflect this strategy in our overall compartment model.

\subsection{Differential Equations}
C, T, and M are proportions of coral, algal turf, and macroalgae cover on the ocean floor, respectively,  where $C+M+T=1$ to signify the proportion of each population is a selected area. P is the population of the parrotfish that inhabit the coral reef ecosystem in proportion to the maximum carrying capacity. The coral reef dynamics are described as a system of nonlinear differential equations \textsuperscript{\cite{13_blackwood_hastings_mumby_2010}}: 
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        \frac{dC}{dt} &= rTC + \sigma P C- (a(t)M+\mu_{1})C\\
        \frac{dP}{dt} &= qP \left( 1-\frac{P}{\beta C} \right) - P \left( h+\mu_{2} \right)\\
        \frac{dT}{dt} &= \mu_{1}C + \frac{g(P)M}{M+T} - T(rC+\phi M)\\
        \frac{dM}{dt} &= (a(t)C+ \phi T)M - \frac{g(P)M}{M+T}
    \end{split}
\end{align}

where: 
\begin{align*}
&g(P) = \frac{\omega P}{\beta}, a(t)=|\frac{a_{0}(9\sin{(\pi t) }+1)}{10}|\\
and\\
&\frac{g(P)M}{M + T} \text{ is the proportion of grazing that affects macroalgae} \textsuperscript{\cite{13_blackwood_hastings_mumby_2010}}.

% graphs
\subsection{Graphs}
Using MatLab (See Appendix \ref{appendix:B1}), we were able to model the dynamics using our preliminary rates. This was achieved by changing the C, M, \& T proportions. Below are the graphs that were were able to achieve:\\
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Latex/Figures/Graphs/0.3C_0.3T_0.3M.png}
    \caption{Initial Conditions: $C = T = M = \frac{1}{3}$, and $P = 1$}
    \label{fig:initial_plot}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Latex/Figures/Graphs/0.5C_0.25T_0.25M.png}
    \caption{Initial Conditions: $C = \frac{1}{2}$, $T = M = \frac{1}{4}$, and $P = 1$}
    \label{fig:coral_dominant}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Latex/Figures/Graphs/0.25C_0.5T_0.25M.png}
    \caption{Initial Conditions: $T = \frac{1}{2}$, $C = M = \frac{1}{4}$, and $P = 1$}
    \label{fig:turf_dominant}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Latex/Figures/Graphs/0.25C_0.25T_0.5M.png}
    \caption{Initial Conditions: $M = \frac{1}{2}$, $C = T = \frac{1}{4}$, and $P = 1$}
    \label{fig:macroalgae_dominant}
\end{figure}
As we can see in Figures \ref{fig:initial_plot}, \ref{fig:coral_dominant}, \ref{fig:turf_dominant}, \& \ref{fig:macroalgae_dominant}, as the parrot fish population decreases, the macroalgae proportion increases. In addition, as the macroalgae proportion increases, the coral proportion decreases, and subsequently the algal turf proportion decreases as well.\\

\subsection{Disease-Free Equilibrium and $\mathscr{R}_{0}$}
The disease-free equilibrium is the point at which no disease is present in the system, in which $M^{0} = 0$. The system of equations becomes
\begin{align*}
        C^{0} &= 1 - \frac{\mu_{1}}{r}\\
        P^{0} &= -\frac{\beta(1 - \frac{\mu_{1}}{r})(h - \mu_{2} - q)}{q}\\
        T^{0} &= \frac{\mu_{1}}{r}\\
        M^{0} &= 0 
\end{align*}
and since C + T + M = 1, if $M^{0} = 0$, then $C^{0} + T^{0} = 1$.Thus, our disease-free equilibrium is at $(1 - \frac{\mu_{1}}{r}, -\frac{\beta(1 - \frac{\mu_{1}}{r})(h - \mu_{2} - q)}{q}, 0, \frac{\mu_{1}}{r})$.

The basic reproduction number, $\mathscr{R}_{0}$, is a metric used to describe the contagiousness or transmissibility of infectious agents $^{\cite{delamater_street_leslie_yang_jacobsen_2019}}$, i.e. the number of secondary infections. For our model, macroalgae is considered to be our infection compartment. Thus, 

\begin{center}

$\displaystyle {\mathscr{R}}_{0} = \frac{\mu_{1}(a r - a\mu_{1} + \phi \mu_{1})}{r^{2}g(P)}$

\end{center}

\subsection{Endemic Equilibrium}
\begin{align*}
        T^{*} &= \frac{\mu_{1} + a(t)M^{*}}{r} \\
        C^{*} %&= 1-(T^{*} + M^{*}) \\
        &= 1- \left(\frac{\mu_{1} + a(t)M^{*}}{r} + M^{*} \right)\\
        P^{*} %&= \beta C^{*} \left(\frac{q-(h+\mu_{2})}{q} \right) \\
        &= \beta \left(1- \left(\frac{\mu_{1} + a(t)M^{*}}{r} + M^{*} \right) \right) \left(\frac{q-(h+\mu_{2})}{q} \right)\\
        M^{*} &= \frac{\omega (\beta \left(1- \left(\frac{\mu_{1} + a(t)M^{*}}{r} + M^{*} \right) \right) \left(\frac{q-(h+\mu_{2})}{q} \right))}{\beta(a(t)(1- \left(\frac{\mu_{1} + a(t)M^{*}}{r} + M^{*}) \right)+\phi \frac{\mu_{1} + a(t)M^{*}}{r})} - \frac{\mu_{1} + a(t)M^{*}}{r} \\
\end{align*}

The Endemic Equilibrium determines at what point will the disease not spread nor will it fully eradicate. Essentially it tells when the disease is stabilized. In order to find the endemic equilibrium, we have to set each differential equal to 0 and solve for each variable. The equations above are in terms of M as M is considered our disease. After finding the equations, the next step would be to substitute the parameters in order to see at what point does each compartment need to be in order to have an Endemic Equilibrium. The endemic will be used in the Game Theory part of the research. 

Example of Calculating $P^{*}$ :
\begin{align*}
        \frac{dP}{dT} &= qP\left(1-\frac{P}{\beta C}\right) - P(h + \mu_{2})\\
        0 &= qP\left(1-\frac{P}{\beta C}\right) - P(h + \mu_{2})\\
        P(h+ \mu_{2}) &= qP\left(1-\frac{P}{\beta C}\right)\\
        \frac{(h+ \mu_{2})}{q} &= \left(1-\frac{P}{\beta C}\right)\\
        \frac{P}{\beta C} &= 1 - \frac{h+\mu_{2}}{q}\\
        P^{*} &= \beta C \left(\frac{q-(h+\mu_{2})}{q}\right)
    \end{align*}

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}
Sensitivity analysis determines the maximum impact of each parameter on the basic reproduction number equation. This process is calculated by performing the partial derivative on the $\mathscr{R}_0$ equation with respect to each parameter value, and substituting the values for the remaining parameter variables. Below is the general equation to calculate sensitivity analysis: \\
\begin{align*}
    S_{\lambda} &=  \frac{\Delta \mathscr{R}_0}{\mathscr{R}_0} \\
    where \lamda is a parameter in the quantity \mathscr{R}_0.
\end{align*}

Utilizing MatLab (Appendix \ref{appendix:B6}), we were able to automate the calculation process, giving us the corresponding sensitivity analysis for each parameter variable. 
\begin{table}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            Parameter & $S_{A}$ \\
            \hline
            \hline
            $\mu_{1}$ & \colorbox{yellow}{\textbf{8.3513}}\\
            \hline
            $\mu_{2}$ & \colorbox{yellow}{\textbf{5.2819}}\\
            \hline
            $q$ & -3.5962\\
            \hline
            $\omega$ & -0.7923\\
            \hline
            $\sigma$ & 0.0000\\
            \hline
            $r$ & -2.5054\\
            \hline
            $\phi$ & 0.4029\\
            \hline
            $\beta$ & 0.0000\\
            \hline
            $h$ & \colorbox{yellow}{\textbf{5.2819}}\\
            \hline
            $a$ & 0.9400\\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Sensitivity Analysis}
        \label{tab:sens_analysis}
    \end{table}
    
    The larger the sensitivity analysis value, the higher the impact the parameter has on our basic reproduction number equation. The highlighted values ($\mu_{1}, \mu_{2}$, and $h$) have the largest sensitivity analysis values, and have the most impact on our basic reproduction number equation, respectively. \par
    The natural death rate of corals ($\mu_{1}$) represents the largest impact, and rightfully so, with a sensitivity analysis value of 8.3513. Due to the dynamics between corals, algal turfs, and macroalgae, the death of corals directly impacts algal turfs. However, the natural death accounts for all factors of coral deaths, including but not limited to bleaching, disease, damage, and so forth. The more corals that die, the more surface area get converted into algal turfs and subsequently gives way for algal turfs to convert into macroalgae. As such, this rate carries the greatest impact on our overall basic reproduction number equation. \par
    The natural death rate of parrotfish ($\mu_{2}$) and the harvest rate of parrotfish due to fishing ($h$) both share the second highest sensitivity analysis value of 5.2819. This presents a unique perspective, as the analysis indicates that there is no difference between natural death and human-driven death. Both simply represent the removal of live parrotfish from the ecosystem rather than the means of removal, and as such are equal. This is significant as our model depicts parrotfish as the primary grazers of macroalgae, and we have acknowledged that macroalgae overgrowth has a negative impact on the ecosystem. When the parrotfish population is adequate, the proportion of macroalgae will be kept in control. However, with the removal of parrotfish from the ecosystem from death or fishing, the macroalgae will have the opportunity to grow unchecked. Thus, the impact of overfishing parrotfish will undeniably affect the dynamics of the ecosystem, and will allow macroalgae to dominate while corals whither away.
    
\section{Harvesting Game Theory}

\section{Literature Review}
Throughout this week, our group has dedicated a large portion of time to reviewing scholarly articles and research publications relevant to our areas of research. This aspect of performing our research is crucial as, through literature review, we are able to gather information, techniques, methods, data, results, and many other variables that we are able to use in our own research. \par
Our faculty mentors have graciously provided several research publications related to the overall study coral reef ecosystems in order to stimulate creativity in creating our own research topic. These papers are as follow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assessing relative resilience potential of coral reefs to inform management\textsuperscript{\cite{01_assesing_relative}}
    \item Model of coral population response to accelerated bleaching and mass mortality in a changing climate\textsuperscript{\cite{02_Riegl_Purkis_Model}}
    \item Prioritizing Key Resilience Indicators to Support Coral Reef Management in a Changing Climate\textsuperscript{\cite{03_prioritize}}
    \item Mathematical analysis of coral reef models\textsuperscript{\cite{04_mathanalysis}}
    \item A Mathematical Model of Coral Reef Response to Destructive Fishing Practices with Predator-Prey Interactions\textsuperscript{\cite{05_quintero_machuca_cotto_bradley_ríos-soto_2016}}
    \item From bee species aggregation to models of disease avoidance: The Ben-Hur effect\textsuperscript{\cite{06_yong_herrera_castillo-chavez_2016}}
    \item Vaccination and the theory of games\textsuperscript{\cite{07_bauch_earn_2004}}
    \item The effect of fishing on hysteresis in Caribbean coral reefs \textsuperscript{\cite{13_blackwood_hastings_mumby_2010}}
\end{itemize}
These articles provide valuable insight in various areas of coral reef research from parameters and conditions to modeling and application. In particular, each of these papers gave us insight on how other researchers approached their problems, how they created and modified their methods, and how they produced results based on their models and equations.

    \subsection{Game Theory}
    Expected Payoff: 
    \begin{align*}
        E (h, h_{pop}) &= -hC^{h} - \frac{h}{h+\mu_{2}} \frac{g(P)(1-h)M}{M+T}
    \end{align*}
    
    \section{MatLab Scripts}
        \subsection{Static Compartment Model Visualization}
        \label{appendix:B1}
        This script represents our MatLab implementation of visualizing our compartment model and dynamics using our known and estimated parameters. The code implements ODE45 in order to calculate our system of differential equations, and plots the results:
        \begin{center}
            %\lstinputlisting[language=Matlab]{./Source Code/Coral_Reefsearchers.m}
            \lstinputlisting[language=Matlab, firstline = 5, lastline = 66]{./Source Code/Coral_Reefsearchers.m}
        \end{center}
        
        \subsection{Dynamic Compartment Model Visualization}
        \label{appendix:B2}
        Similarly to our Static Compartment Model Visualization (Appendix \ref{appendix:B1}) script, this script visualizes and models our system of differential equations using ODE45. However, this differs from the previous in that it allows for parameter simulations, and subsequently able to create a frame-by-frame animation of the changes:
        \begin{center}
            \lstinputlisting[language=Matlab, firstline = 71, lastline = 151]{./Source Code/Coral_Reefsearchers.m}
        \end{center}
        
        \subsection{Disease Free Equilibrium}
        \label{appendix:B3}
        This script utilizes MatLab's symbolic toolbox feature to calculate our disease free equilibrium equations:
        \begin{center}
            \lstinputlisting[language=Matlab, firstline = 157, lastline = 180]{./Source Code/Coral_Reefsearchers.m}
        \end{center}
        
        \subsection{Basic Reproduction Number: $\mathscr{R}_0$}
        \label{appendix:B4}
        Using our disease free equilibrium equations (Appendix \ref{appendix:B3}), we are then able to set-up and calculate our basic reproduction number ($\mathscr{R}_0$), which depicts the equilibrium of the system:
        \begin{center}
            \lstinputlisting[language=Matlab, firstline = 185, lastline = 206]{./Source Code/Coral_Reefsearchers.m}
        \end{center}
        
        \subsection{Threshold}
        \label{appendix:B5}
        This script uses our disease free equilibrium (Appendix \ref{appendix:B3}) and our basic reproduction number (Appendix \ref{appendix:B4}) to calculate our harvesting rate threshold, beyond which the system would become unstable:
        \begin{center}
            \lstinputlisting[language=Matlab, firstline = 210, lastline = 240]{./Source Code/Coral_Reefsearchers.m}
        \end{center}
        
        \subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}
        This script analyzes the impact of each parameter on our basic reproduction number equation by taking the partial derivative and substituting the variables with parameter values:
        \label{appendix:B6}
        \begin{center}
            \lstinputlisting[language=Matlab, firstline = 245, lastline = 260]{./Source Code/Coral_Reefsearchers.m}
        \end{center}
        
        \subsection{Endemic Equilibrium}
        \label{appendix:B7}
        This script calculates the endemic equilibrium of our system of differential equations:        
        \begin{center}
            \lstinputlisting[language=Matlab, firstline = 265, lastline = 307]{./Source Code/Coral_Reefsearchers.m}
        \end{center}
